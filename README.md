# lifespark_backend_project
A RESTful API built with Spring Boot to manage patient data, providing functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) patient records. The API uses MongoDB for data storage and JWT for secure authentication.
To set up the Patient Management API, start by cloning the project repository from GitHub and navigate into the project directory. Make sure MongoDB is installed and running locally on its default port, as the API uses MongoDB to store patient data. Next, open the applicationâ€™s configuration file, located in the resources folder, and update it with your MongoDB connection details. Additionally, set up a JWT secret key, which will be used to secure the API endpoints through token-based authentication. Once configured, use Maven, a build automation tool, to build the application, which compiles the code and prepares it for running. Finally, launch the application with a single command; it will start the server, making the API available on localhost:8080. Now, you can test the API using tools like Postman by sending HTTP requests to the provided endpoints.

This API is designed to perform basic CRUD operations on patient records, allowing you to create, read, update, and delete patient data. Most endpoints require a valid JWT token for access, except the endpoint for creating new patient records. Each request to the API receives a standardized HTTP response code, such as 201 for successful creation or 404 if a patient is not found. This ensures consistency in how clients interact with the API.
